detailed pipeline tailored to mouse RNA sequencing analysis to identify pathways associated with up and downregulated genes
Mouse RNA-Seq Analysis Workflow
# Introduction
This repository provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide for analyzing RNA-seq data to identify up- and downregulated genes and their associated pathways. The workflow assumes no prior coding experience and includes all commands, package installations, and reasoning behind chosen input options.
