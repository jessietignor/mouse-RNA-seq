### Introduction

This repository provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide for analyzing mouse RNA-seq data to identify up and downregulated genes. The workflow assumes no prior coding experience and includes all commands, package installations, and reasoning behind chosen input options.

### 1. Environment Setup

# Install Conda Package Manager

Conda simplifies package installation and environment management.

The easiest way to set up the RNAseq environment is by using a bio-cookie template. This template will download all the necessary tools into a new virtual environment, so that there are no disruptions with your current computer packaging versions. It is high reccomended to run on all of these commands on a high performance cluster.

The template will also ask if you would like to download a human or mouse genome for transcriptome alignment. If you want to align to a genome which is neither human or murine, then you must select "None" in the option and download the genome and annotation file separately. Below are a list of the tools which are downloaded during the installation steps. See here for a list of availabel genomes (<https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway> / <http://useast.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html> )
